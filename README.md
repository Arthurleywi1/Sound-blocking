The stapedius muscle
This is another muscle in the middle ear that protects to loud noises. These autonomic fibers enable the muscle to be involved in the auditory middle ear reflex, having a crucial role in protecting the auditory system from damage.

When two waves have opposite-phase
(phi = 180), they interfere destructively and
Cancel each other out.

output for two waves with same amplitude and opposite phase

Two waves are added and we get the third wave has zero because it has destructively interfered.
